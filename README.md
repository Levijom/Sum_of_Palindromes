There is a study by JAVIER CILLERUELO, FLORIAN LUCA, AND LEWIS BAXTER (linked above) which says any positive integer of g >= 5 can be written as the sum of 3 palindrome numbers with base g.

A palindrome number is a number that can be read backward or forward and read the same way
EX: 1001; 123454321, 22665656622 etc

The idea is to be able to take all the rules out of thie 42 page analysis, and be able to have the user input any number and have the code output the 3 palindrome numbers which add up to it.

I do not know if i want to do this in exclusively base 10, or do it for all bases as the paper says it is possible to execute it in any base.
